<h1>The Best Movies According to Yudereddy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man</h3>
<p>This is my favourite super hero movie. The story follows a timid teenager named Peter Parker who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider.</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>This animated film made me cry like a baby.  Inside Out follows the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her family's relocation as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions.</p>
<h3>Beethoven</h3>
<p>I just love a american family comedy film. The film's story centers on a St. Bernard dog named after a German composer who finds a home with a suburban family.</p>
